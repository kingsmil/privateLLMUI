Helping more middle-income earners save more with CPF
1. Increase in CPF monthly salary ceiling
As salaries in Singapore continue to rise, the maximum amount of monthly wages eligible for CPF contributions (also known as the CPF monthly salary ceiling) is periodically reviewed to help members in increasing their CPF savings. This monthly wage ceiling is currently set at $6,000.



From 2023 to 2026, the CPF monthly salary ceiling will be progressively increased to $8,000. It is important to note that the changes will be implemented in four gradual steps, which gives both employers and employees time to adjust to the new regulations. The CPF annual salary ceiling of $102,000 remains unchanged.

 	CPF monthly salary ceiling 	CPF annual salary ceiling
Current 	$6,000	$102,000
From 1 September 2023 	$6,300 (+$300)
From 1 January 2024	$6,800 (+$500)
From 1 January 2025 	$7,400 (+$600)
From 1 January 2026 	$8,000 (+$600)
HOW THIS BENEFITS YOU:
Starting from 1 September 2023, if your current monthly salary exceeds $6,000, you will receive more CPF contributions because of the increased limit. This means that a greater proportion of your salary will be allocated towards your CPF savings.



Additionally, your employer will also be required to contribute on a higher amount - resulting in more CPF savings for your retirement needs.



While the increased monthly salary ceiling may result in a lower take-home pay, this allows more middle income CPF members to save more with CPF and help with their future needs.

More support for seniors
2. Increased CPF contribution rates for senior workers (55 to 70)
Employee's age (years) 	CPF Contribution Rates from 1 January 2024

CPF contribution rates were raised for senior workers in 2022 and 2023. Following Budget 2023, the government will also be increasing the contribution rates further from 1 January 2024.

The increased CPF contribution, like past increments, is channelled into the CPF Special Account to enable senior workers to accumulate more retirement savings.

HOW THIS BENEFITS YOU:
If you are a senior worker, you will enjoy higher contributions made by your employers.



This will lead to a corresponding increase in your monthly CPF LIFE payouts and can provide enhanced retirement support, particularly if you plan to continue working after the retirement age.



3. Increase in minimum CPF monthly payouts for non-CPF LIFE members
Those who are not on CPF LIFE will stand to benefit too.



Starting in June 2023, the minimum monthly payout for non-CPF LIFE members (i.e. those enrolled in the Retirement Sum Scheme) will increase from $250 to $350. There is no change for members already receiving monthly payouts of $350 or more.

HOW THIS BENEFITS YOU:
If you are not on CPF LIFE, the increased minimum monthly payout would mean that you can enjoy higher monthly payouts until your CPF savings are fully utilised.



However, this would also mean that your current retirement savings might be depleted faster. You can consider boosting your retirement savings by making cash top-ups.

Easier processes for seniors to receive their monthly payouts
4. Auto-conversion of CPF inflows into monthly payouts
Members who have started receiving their CPF LIFE payouts may have received additional contributions to their Ordinary and Special Account (OSA), such as the case of senior workers.



If they have not set aside their cohort's Full Retirement Sum (FRS), these contributions will not be available for lump-sum withdrawal and are meant to be disbursed as monthly payouts. These members need to manually inform the CPF Board to annuitise their OSA savings (i.e. convert their savings to monthly payments) for higher CPF LIFE payouts.



Starting in October 2023, the CPF Board will simplify the process for these members to enjoy greater monthly CPF LIFE payouts. Any non-withdrawable savings in their OSA will be automatically annuitised, resulting in higher payouts. An individual notification will be sent to affected members before the annuitisation occurs.



Members who have set aside their cohort FRS will not have their OSA savings automatically annuitised, ensuring that these savings remain withdrawable at any time.

HOW THIS BENEFITS YOU:
If you have not set aside your cohort’s FRS, you will find it easier to receive higher payouts as there is no need to inform the CPF board to annuitise the OSA savings for higher CPF LIFE payouts in the future.



This simplifies the process and eliminates the need for members to take additional steps to increase their payouts.

5. Automatic commencement of monthly payouts for those born before 1948
CPF savings are intended to provide monthly retirement income to members - who can choose to start their payouts from age 65. To do so, they would need to manually instruct the CPF Board.



However, there are members who neglected to do so when they turn 65 years old. This prompted a change in 2018 for members to automatically receive payouts when they turn 70 (born in or after 1948).

HOW THIS BENEFITS YOU:
The automatic commencement of monthly payouts is now extended to members born before 1948 (i.e. those aged above 75), with around 85,000 members starting to receive payouts in their bank account from their birth month in June 2023. These members will be individually notified beforehand.

TIP
Even with these changes, it’s still important to remember that you can choose to start your CPF LIFE payouts at any time from age 65. Simply instruct the board via the Plan My Payouts form. Note that you may only defer your CPF LIFE monthly payouts up to age 70.

Helping platform workers save more for their retirement
6. CPF contributions for platform workers below age 30
Platform workers such as delivery workers and private-hire drivers have less certainty in their earnings as compared to salaried employees. This makes it more important for them to consider how they can retire  to be an important one.



To address this, platform workers below the age of 30 will be required to make CPF contributions from late 2024. The contribution rates of platform workers and the platform companies will be aligned to those of employees and employers respectively. Those who are older than 30 years old can also opt-in.



The CPF contributions will be phased over a period of five years. Platform workers who earn $500 or less in a month do not need to make CPF contributions.



To cushion the impact on take-home pay for lower-income platform workers, the Government will also introduce the Platform Worker CPF Transition Support from 2024 to 2027 to offset part of the additional CPF contributions. Singaporean platform workers who earn S$2,500 or less per month – including from platform work and other employment sources – will be eligible for the scheme if they are required to make CPF contributions or opt-in to do so.



Additionally, eligible workers will also receive higher Workfare payments when the CPF contributions for platform workers are fully aligned with employees.

HOW THIS BENEFITS YOU:
If you were born in 1995 or later and working as a platform worker, you will receive CPF contributions from your platform company and have more retirement savings from 2024 onwards. You can also use your CPF Ordinary Account savings for your housing expenses. Refer to the MOM’s website for more details.

Addressing cost-of-living concerns
There are also measures in place to assist with current cost-of-living concerns.

7. More Government support with increase in Assurance Package benefits
As announced in Budget 2023, the Government will be increasing the Assurance Package (AP) further from $6.6 billion to $9.6 billion.



The $3 billion increase takes into account higher inflation and provides additional one-time support to help Singaporeans with their cost-of-living concerns in 2023. Some examples of support are listed below.



HOW THIS BENEFITS YOU:
Assurance Package (AP) Cash
About 2.9 million adult Singaporeans will get between S$700 and S$2,250 in total over five years - an increase of up to S$650 from what was earlier announced.



Assurance Package (AP) MediSave

Every Singaporean aged (i) 20 years and below, or (ii) 55 years and above, will receive up to $450 in their CPF MediSave Account from 2023 to 2025.


The amount will be disbursed over three years, starting from Feb 2023.



Assurance Package Senior’s Bonus (previously known as GSTV – Cash (Seniors’ Bonus))
Lower-income senior Singapore citizens will receive cash payments of $600 to $900 through the Assurance Package (AP) Seniors' Bonus. The payment will be disbursed over three years from 2023 to 2025.



Assurance Package (AP) – U-Save

Eligible HDB households will receive additional U-Save rebates under the Assurance Package from 2023-2026 to help offset their monthly utilities bills.



The AP U-Save rebates are on top of the regular GSTV – U-Save rebates under the GSTV scheme and will be credited together with households' regular GSTV – U-Save in the relevant months.



Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers

On top of the $100 CDC Vouchers that were announced in October 2022 as part of the $1.5 billion Cost-of-Living package, an additional $100 CDC Vouchers will also be introduced in 2024 as part of the enhancements to the Assurance Package.



In total, all Singaporean households will receive $600 worth of CDC Vouchers in 2023 and 2024.

8. Increased usage of MediSave and review of MediShield Life coverage to help manage healthcare costs
Extended use of MediSave for homebound patients
From late 2023, homebound patients who receive treatment for the conditions covered under the Chronic Disease Management Programme can use MediSave 500/700 and Flexi-MediSave schemes to pay for home medical care.



This means such patients can use up to $500 or $700 early (depending on the complexity of the medical condition) from their MediSave savings to pay for medical bills, including consultation fees and blood tests conducted at home. Patients who are aged 60 and above can also use an additional $300 yearly under Flexi MediSave.



Increased coverage for cancer medication under MediShield Life

To assure the affordability of cancer drug treatments, MediShield Life claim limits for cancer drug services have been increased to $3,600 per calendar year. There is no change to the MediSave withdrawal limit of $600 per calendar year. Patients who have made cancer drug services claims in 2023 will be able to make additional MediShield Life claims from 1 April 2023, up to the new limit.

HOW THIS BENEFITS YOU:
Given that one of the key concerns about ageing is managing healthcare costs, extending the use of MediSave and reviewing coverage of MediShield Life are key steps to take.



For example,  the new changes take into account how we can make fuller use of technology in our healthcare. In addition, the review of MediShield Life’s claim limits will help more cancer patients manage their finances more effectively.



If you are looking for ways to manage your healthcare finances with these new changes, don’t forget the benefits of topping up your MediSave savings in cash while you are at it!

New changes to CPF – what do they mean for you in the long term?
